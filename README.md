This project rigorously investigates the fundamental trade-off between privacy preservation and adversarial robustness in fully decentralized federated learning (FL). Specifically, we analyze the impact of various privacy mechanisms on the detectability of Byzantine attacks within a Primal-Dual Method of Multipliers (PDMM) based FedAVG framework.

## Overview

The core objective of this research is to demonstrate that strengthening privacy inevitably degrades the ability to detect malicious (Byzantine) behavior in decentralized FL. We achieve this by:
*   Implementing a decentralized FedAVG scheme utilizing PDMM for model aggregation.
*   Integrating three distinct privacy-preserving mechanisms: Differential Privacy (DP), Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC), and Subspace Perturbation (SP).
*   Simulating a range of active Byzantine attacks to corrupt model updates.
*   Employing a Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) based detection algorithm to identify adversarial nodes.
*   Quantifying the privacy-robustness trade-off using False Alarm Rate (FAR) and Missed Detection Rate (MDR) as key metrics.
